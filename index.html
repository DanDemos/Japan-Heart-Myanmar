                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          Ma Hnin Thadar Phyu, a 2-year-old child patient who
                          came from a remote area of ​​Yangon, was a 2-year-old
                          child patient who had a colostomy (used as a stool
                          outlet instead of an anus) in her abdomen. A medical
                          condition that made it difficult for her to pass stool
                          easily as a newborn required surgery to create an
                          artificial anus a few days after birth. Two years have
                          passed since then, and this time she needed a surgery
                          to close the hole in her tummy, but due to the
                          difficult conditions in Myanmar, it was not easy to
                          find a hospital that could perform the surgery. Later,
                          her parents got contact of Japan Heart and arrived at
                          Wachet Hospital to receive operation. It was difficult
                          for a 2-year-old as there were food restrictions in
                          the days after surgery, but she really worked hard to
                          overcome it. Little Hnin, who likes to talk and to
                          stay pretty, cried sometimes when she was first
                          admitted at the hospital, but soon became familiar to
                          the staffs and became good friends. Amidst the
                          complicated work at the hospital, little Hnin’s way of
                          speaking and cute smile are a cup of medicine for the
                          teachers at the hospital. Little Hnin has now been
                          discharged from the hospital, healthy and happy.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                          In the 2015-2016 academic year, I had the opportunity
                          to attend a 1-year course in medical massage taught by
                          Japan Heart and worked as a massage therapist. The
                          youngest son, born to farmer parents in Wa Khe Ma,
                          Irrawaddy, was born blind, so I was given special care
                          by my parents. Due to the family’s economic situation
                          and my parents’ weak views on the blind, I was unable
                          to study at a school. At the age of 6, I went to study
                          at private School for the Blind in Yangon, but I was
                          unhappy and returned home. At the age of 22, despite
                          my parents’ unwillingness, I decided to leave home to
                          learn massage to get a job on my own, and because I
                          had never been to school, I had many difficulties in
                          learning, but as a result of my passion, teaching
                          support and hard work, I reached the life of a massage
                          therapist I envisioned. When I started working at a
                          blind massage shop, I had to continue to learn how to
                          manage human relationship, to be a part of good
                          working environment and skill up my massage treatment
                          techniques for many years to be able to give the best
                          treatment services. I am now happily working in a
                          private massage shop in Hlaing Township with my wife,
                          from Meikhtila, Ma Ei Ei Phyo, who graduated from
                          massage school in 2014-2015. Now, I have established
                          my own family and supported my parents’ medical
                          expenses with my own income. I have the opportunity to
                          be a parent who can raise my 4-year-old son. Being
                          able to benefit the patients around me with massage
                          therapy, I am satisfied with my life. I am also trying
                          to open my own shop one day.

                        <p>
                          From May 2010 to 2011, the medical massage therapist
                          course opened by Japan Heart, was taught directly by
                          Japanese teacher Mr. Shinya Shiozaki, I was able to
                          learn both the manual and practical subjects without
                          difficulty with the translation support of Myanmar
                          staff interpreters. In 2011-2012, it was fun and
                          interesting to practice teaching to two students at
                          Myitkyina School for the Blind, the mother school of
                          mine, and to visit excursion field trips to other
                          schools for the blind in different regions every 3
                          months. Local knowledge was also gained. In 2012, I
                          received a teacher’s certificate and taught as an
                          assistant teacher. In November 2013, I passed the
                          entrance exam of the Japanese Medical Massage, and
                          from March 2014 to March 2017, I had the opportunity
                          to study and represent Myanmar at Tsukuba University’s
                          blind massage training school for 3 years. Although
                          there were language difficulties, thanks to the help
                          of teachers and Japanese friends, I was able achieve
                          the same marks as other students and passed the
                          Japanese government’s massage therapist licensing
                          exam. After returning to Myanmar, I have been working
                          as a teacher since as it’s my childhood dream, at the
                          training school opened by Japan Heart for the blind
                          people to lead independent lives. In the future, as
                          long as I receive support from Japan Heart, I would
                          like to continue working in the development and
                          teaching sector of the blind. In addition, I was able
                          to open the Sakura Sakura massage shop with basic
                          equipment support from Japan Heart, was closed for 2
                          years during the COVID-19 epidemic, but was able to
                          reopen with the monthly salary support from Japan
                          Heart and the income received from Mobile Massage
                          Customers who trust in me. In the future, I wish to
                          expand and open new massage shops not only for my own
                          benefit but also for the employment opportunities of
                          the blind.

                        <p>
                          U Tin Moe attended Japan Heart Medical Massage Teacher
                          Training Course in 2011 – 2012. The reason I studied
                          medical massage is to share it with blind children and
                          to make a living. During the course, I experienced
                          enjoying learning from a Japanese teacher who teaches
                          well and has strict discipline, enjoy learning medical
                          massage subjects, making friends from various schools,
                          obtaining good teaching and learning methods. After
                          completing the course, I feel happy for learning a
                          skill and increasing knowledge. I am glad to learn
                          about the blind massage therapists from Japan and
                          internationally about. We are happy to have the
                          opportunity to teach back massage techniques to blind
                          children in the future. In practice, there are
                          successes and difficulties. As achievements; In 2014,
                          we were able to open a school for the blind named, Ba
                          Wa Thit (New Life in meaning), and teach massage
                          therapy to blind students. Since 2015, I have been
                          able to start teaching therapeutic massage courses
                          based on the Japanese Anma technique, taught by
                          instructor Mr. Shinya Shiozaki from Japan Heart, to
                          about ten blind students. From 2015 to 2023, a total
                          of 70 students were taught therapeutic massage. There
                          were some difficulties in teaching because of the lack
                          of teaching aids, such as a human skeleton that can be
                          touch by hand, made of natural fiber and modal of
                          internal organs. The purpose of starting a school for
                          the blind are to educate blind students in Myanmar,
                          where there are not enough schools for the blind to
                          learn. Since I am blind, I want to make blind people
                          educated. The current teaching situation at the school
                          for the blind is Class literature (Kg to university
                          level), Music (Myanmar music and western music),
                          therapeutic massage, Computer and Android Phone Access
                          Technology, Crafts (making baskets, wallets,

                          facing are the need for funds for the regular
                          operation of school activities, the need to be fully
                          staffed, Acomes of blind people’s life development

                          As an intern, I mainly worked on public relations and
                          translation of hand written letters to develop
                          connections between children at Dream Train and their
                          foster parents. It was a valuable experience for me,
                          as I learnt a lot from sharing with the people of
                          Japan the thoughts and feelings hidden in the hearts
                          of the children and their growth, which I would not
                          normally talk about. Although I have finished my
                          internship, I would like to continue to be involved
                          with Dream Train in the future by visiting facilities
                          and donating supplies.

                          I believe that we Japanese should support the people

                          will keep our support.

                          I would like to thank everyone involved in Japan Heart
                          for the many children's lives that have been saved
                          through their work. When I visited the hospital in
                          Myanmar some time ago, I was impressed by Dr
                          Yoshioka's efforts to save as many children as
                          possible. I was impressed by the way he spoke of his
                          frustration at the fact that there were still children
                          who could not be saved, and decided to support Dr
                          Yoshioka and Japan Heart's activities. I am honored to
                          be involved, even if only a little, in the
                          construction of the Asian Children's Medical Centre.
